Convolutional Neural Networks to Recognize Facial Expressions (FER2013)

This project aims to use Convolutional Neural Networks and PyTorch to recognize facial expression from FER2013 dataset for the Knowledge Discovery course of Data Science for Management MSc (University of Catania).

## Description

![alt text](https://github.com/raffaeleb92/CNN_FER2013/blob/main/fer_kd_architecture.png)

FER_KD is a deep model that consists of 5 convolutional layers and 1 full-connected layerto perform multiclass classification. 
Input pictures (48x48 faces pictures) flowsfrom the beginning to the end of the model.  The model ultimately classify the emotion ofthe picture in one of the 7 classes (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise and neutral).


## Usage

Clone the repository and unzip the zip dataset on the same folder of the notebook.

Google Colab usage is recommended due to the complexity of the model.
