Convolutional Neural Networks to Recognize Facial Expressions (FER2013)

This project aims to use Convolutional Neural Networks and PyTorch to recognize facial expression from FER2013 dataset for the Knowledge Discovery course of Data Science for Management MSc (University of Catania).

## Description

FERKDis a deep model that consists of 5 convolutional layers and 1 full-connected layerto perform multiclass classification .  Input pictures (48x48 faces pictures) flowsfrom the beginning to the end of the model.  The model ultimately classify the emotion ofthe picture in one of the 7 classes (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise and neutral).
